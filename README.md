This is a program to remove temporary files from windows, to improve performace.

1. The program starts with 4 predefined paths to clear that you can remove using checkboxes.

  - %temp% (C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp)
  - Temp (C:\Windows\Temp)
  - Prefetch (C:\Windows\Prefetch)
  - Windows Temporary Files (C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download)<br><br>

2. You can add paths to clear by entering the path at the top of the app and clicking the "add" button.<br><br>
